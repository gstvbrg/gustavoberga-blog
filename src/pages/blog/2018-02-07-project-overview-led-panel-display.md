> **"Hardware is becoming much more like software,"** as MIT professor Eric Von Hippel puts it. The Web was just the proof-of-concept of what an open, bottom-up, collaborative industrial model could look like. **Now the revolution hits the real world.**

***I was in the midst of an entire recalibration***, having realized that creative expression was vastly more fundamental to me than I had accounted for. This core drive had dominated my youth, yet had slowly dissolved from my immediate concern and long term trajectory. This "prudent" neglect lead me to increasingly unfulfilling circumstances, ultimately triggering acute existential dread for a life in which creativity did not play a central role. At this inflection point, Andersonâ€™s 2012 book Makers was a beacon in the dark as I tried to bridge the gap between what I wanted to do and how to do it.
